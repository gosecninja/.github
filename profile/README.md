# GoSecNinja OÃœ

Not everyone needs a full-time certified security expert in their life. But we all want to ensure our safety.

GoSecNinja is all about sharing information.

When we talk about cyber security, we often fall into the trap of talking in jargon. Seemingly simple tasks turn into bigger and never-ending projects.

And the word "security" itself is forgotten, because we hear it everywhere. That's why we try to avoid it as much as possible, because we don't understand it. It costs too much.

But what if I told you that not only does it not cost much, but we can't live without it. All we have to do is realize the value of our own information base and how we can share it with others.

**Let's make the internet a safer place together!**

## "Sponsore tiers"

I thought a lot about possible ways of support this idea. But I haven't found the right names yet. This is why the quote signs.

### Supporter

If you find something useful in what I have to say, but don't expect anything in return. I'm happy if you support me with a share. With constructive feedback. And maybe with a recommendation.

If you want to be more generous than that, Tip for a Tip is just for you.

### Sponsor

I couldn't come up with a better name. A Sponser is someone who wants something in return for support.

I'm still working on the exchange rewards. I would like to convey what I have to say to as many people as possible. That's why I create content on multiple platforms. (If I don't have the mental energy for one, I might still manage to create on another.)

But I think about these things.
- Logo display in the content.
- Supported videos
- Displaying your sponsor names at the end of the content.
- Physical copies. When there is already a webshop or digital content, can be converted into physical.

What can fall into this category is still being worked out. First of all, I do not support ideas that threaten mental health or safety.

### Role models?

I couldn't come up with a better name. A role model is someone whose ideas I find useful. That's why I already joined the community of my own free will. I will share what they have to say with my own thoughts, or I will support them in other ways.

### Brothers in arms

Fortunately, I am not alone in this struggle. I am constantly looking for the company and experience of those who think in a similar way.

Hopefully, we can make the internet safer together soon. Get in touch and let's find out how.
